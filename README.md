CATE
====

Cross-chain Atomic Trading Engine

CATE is a multicoin wallet based on the bitcoinj and libdohj libraries.
It currently supports Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin, and is readily
extensible to support any other currencies compatible with bitcoinj.

CATE is currently in development and should not be used outside of the
test networks until it has significantly further testing. It is likely
there are bugs which result in loss of funds.
