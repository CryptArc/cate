        <p>CATE is a multicoin wallet based on the bitcoinj and libdohj libraries.
            It currently supports Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin, and is readily
            extensible to support any other currencies compatible with bitcoinj.
        </p>

        <p>Application launch is via the {@link org.libdohj.cate.CATE} class, which
            constructs the JavaFX scene and passes control to {@link org.libdohj.cate.controller.MainController}.
            MainController is the main window permanently visible to the user,
            and interacts with the underly wallets on behalf of the user. Due to
            the architecture of bitcoinj using thread-local variables to track
            the active coin, each coin requires its own isolated thread(s).
            The {@link org.libdohj.cate.Network} class acts as a bridge from the
            UI to the underlying wallet, and each instance is its own independent
            thread.</p>

        <p>Calls from the main controller to a wallet involve a jump between
            threads, and as such the result is returned via callbacks. Expected
            errors (i.e. insufficient funds to send a transaction) are returned
            via callbacks as well, while exceptions (i.e. null pointers) are
            sent out of band from the network to the main controller.</p>
